# Qualtrics SDK React Native Sample Apps

In this repository you will find sample Apps with Qualtrics React Native SDK.

## Structure

- **sample-expo/** - React Native Expo sample application demonstrating Qualtrics SDK integration.

## Setting up the Intercept

We suggest testing the example applications using the Intercept with Display/Targeting Logic set up to:

> If View Count Total Views Greater Than or Equal to 1

That way, the intercept will show with every call of `registerViewVisit` making it easy to test.

You can check out the [Qualtrics Documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/f23ebb864cba1-getting-started-with-react-native-sdk) for more information on how to set up the Display Logic.
